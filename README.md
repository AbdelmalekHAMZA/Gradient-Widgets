# Gradient Widgets

A simple and mostly automatic material search bar for flutter (dart).

Note: use `flutter_search_bar` and not `search_bar` -- I own both packages but I'm just a tad bit locked out of `search_bar`, so it won't be updated.

## Screenshots

Normal state (search is not active yet, only `title` and `actions` are set, with the only action being a search button)
